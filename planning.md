Identify and document no fewer than 10 individual and specific uses. Make a list in your planning.md document.
Much like the table you created in your first CSS code review's README, specifically detail how and why you will be use each technology in this list.
In order to execute this project well, we expect you'll need to continue researching SASS. This is intentional. Spend as much of the day as you need reading documentation and tutorials, finding code snippets, and making your tools work in example projects before building the actual site. Much like in your internship and future job, doing your own research up front will make the application of your own solutions much smoother. Take the time to practice this now!

## Specs
| Term  | Description | Implementation |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
|variable | add any variable to an element then use that element as a property | we will set a color theme using variables to call at various points throughout document |
|nesting | allows you to nest css selectors to enhance the logical flow of your stylesheet | going with the logical flow of DOM structure, embedded elements, ie, navbar elements can inherit some properties from parent and be called to have enhanced properties |
|partials | allows you to modularize your stylesheet | we will follow the 7-1 architecture and export like-elements of our stylesheet to partials|
|import | allows you to keep your stylesheet DRY by connecting partials to your main stylesheet | we will keep stylesheet DRY and import aspects according to partials file-structure |
|extend| keeps stylesheet DRY by sharing properties of selectors |  |
|media queries| allows for DRY incorporation of media queries nested within selector properties | approx. 3 elements have media query-esque functionality, we will apply their media-query changes to the selectors |
|card (component)| allows for boilerplate formatting on card elements | we will set certain properties to apply to all cards, ie padding/margin, content structure |
|timeline ul (component)| allows for boilerplate formatting on 'timeline' (ul class) structure| we will set certain properties to apply to our ul w/ timeline class, ie, block structure and font sizing, circular border around images |
| navbar links (component)| allows for boilerplate formatting on navbar menu items  | we will set certain properties on navbar menu items (li's) to show upon larger media screenwidth and collape into burger on smaller media screenwidths |
